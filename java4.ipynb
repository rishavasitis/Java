    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Shape` interface declares a method called `draw()`. The `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes implement the `Shape` interface and provide their own implementations for the `draw()` method. In the `main()` method, we create instances of the `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes using the `Shape` interface reference. This allows us to call the `draw()` method on the objects, and the appropriate implementation is invoked.\n",

    "\n",
    "    // Abstract method\n",
    "    public abstract void brake();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car extends Vehicle {\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void accelerate() {\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Vehicle` class is an abstract class that contains two concrete methods (`startEngine()` and `stopEngine()`) and two abstract methods (`accelerate()` and `brake()`). The `Car` class extends the `Vehicle` class and provides implementations for the abstract methods. In the `main()` method, we create an instance of the `Car` class and call the concrete and abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Here's an example program to show the use of a functional interface in Java:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@FunctionalInterface\n",
    "interface MathOperation {\n",
    "    int operate(int a, int b);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class FunctionalInterfaceExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        MathOperation add = (a, b) -> a + b;\n",
    "        MathOperation subtract = (a, b) -> a - b;\n",
    "\n",
    "        int result1 = add.operate(5, 3);\n",
    "        int result2 = subtract.operate(8, 4);\n",
    "\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Result 1: \" + result1); // Output: 8\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Result 2: \" + result2); // Output: 4\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `MathOperation` interface is a functional interface with a single abstract method (`operate()`) declared. It represents a mathematical operation that takes two integers and returns an integer result. In the `main()` method, we create instances of the functional interface using lambda expressions to define the behavior of the `operate()` method. We can then call the `operate()` method on these instances and get the desired results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. An interface in Java is a reference type that defines a contract of behaviors that a class implementing the interface must adhere to. It specifies a set of methods (and optionally constants) that a class must implement. An interface serves as a blueprint for classes, providing a way to achieve abstraction and establish common behavior across unrelated classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, an interface defines what methods a class should have, but it does not provide the implementation of those methods. It acts as a contract that any class implementing the interface must follow, ensuring consistency and interoperability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. The use of interfaces in Java provides the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstraction: Interfaces allow you to define a common set of methods that classes can implement, promoting abstraction. By programming to interfaces rather than specific implementations, you can work with objects at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on what they can do rather than how they do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple Inheritance: Java supports multiple inheritance of interfaces, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces. This enables a class to inherit and provide the behaviors defined in multiple interfaces, providing flexibility and code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loose Coupling: Interfaces facilitate loose coupling between classes. By depending on interfaces rather than concrete classes, you reduce the dependencies between classes, making the code more modular, maintainable, and flexible. Interfaces promote the \"program to an interface, not an implementation\" principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- API Design: Interfaces are often used to define APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in Java. They provide a clear and standardized way for classes to interact with each other, making it easier to develop and integrate software components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polymorphism: Interfaces play a crucial role in achieving polymorphism. They allow objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through their common interface. This flexibility enables code to be written in a way that can work with different implementations interchangeably."

    "6. A lambda expression in Java 8 is a concise way to represent a block of code that can be treated as a method argument, stored in a variable, or passed as a parameter. It allows you to write more compact and readable code by eliminating the need for anonymous inner classes in certain scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Yes, you can pass lambda expressions to a method in Java. This is possible when the method parameter is of a functional interface type. A functional interface is an interface that has only one abstract method. Lambda expressions can be used to provide the implementation of that single abstract method, which can then be passed as an argument to the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. A functional interface in Java 8 is an interface that has exactly one abstract method. Functional interfaces are used to leverage the power of lambda expressions. They provide a way to define contracts for lambda expressions, allowing them to be used as instances of that functional interface type. Java 8 introduced the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation to explicitly mark an interface as a functional interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Lambda expressions in Java 8 offer several benefits:\n",
    "- Conciseness: Lambda expressions allow you to write more compact code by reducing the boilerplate code required for anonymous inner classes. They enable you to express functionality in a shorter and more readable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Readability: Lambda expressions provide a more declarative and expressive way to represent behavior. They make the code more self-explanatory and easier to understand, especially for simple and concise operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility: Lambda expressions allow for more flexible and modular code. They can be used as method arguments, stored in variables, or passed around within a program. This enhances the flexibility and reusability of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enable Functional Programming: Lambda expressions are a key feature of functional programming in Java. They enable functional programming paradigms such as passing behavior as data, writing higher-order functions, and working with immutable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. No, it is not mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters. Lambda expressions can be parameterless, depending on the context and the functional interface being used. If a functional interface does not require any input parameters, you can create a lambda expression without specifying any parameters. However, if the functional interface has input parameters, you need to include them in the lambda expression's parameter list. The decision to include or exclude parameters depends on the specific requirements and behavior defined by the functional interface."
