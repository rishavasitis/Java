    "1 . Conditional operators in Java are used to perform logical operations and make decisions based on conditions. The main conditional operators in Java are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparison Operators:** These operators compare two values and return a boolean result. They include `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), and `<=` (less than or equal to).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logical Operators:** These operators combine multiple conditions and return a boolean result. They include `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), and `!` (logical NOT).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conditional Operator (Ternary Operator):** This operator provides a compact way to write conditional expressions. It takes three operands and returns a value based on a condition. The syntax is `condition ? expression1 : expression2`. If the condition is true, it evaluates `expression1`; otherwise, it evaluates `expression2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 . Operators in Java can be classified based on the number of operands they work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unary Operators:** These operators work with a single operand. Examples include the increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators, logical NOT (`!`), and negation (`-`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Operators:** These operators work with two operands. Examples include arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.), and comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ternary Operator:** The ternary operator (`condition ? expression1 : expression2`) is the only operator in Java that works with three operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 . The switch case statement in Java is used when we have multiple possible options and want to execute different code blocks based on the value of a particular variable or expression. It provides a structured way to handle multiple conditions. The main use of the switch case statement is to simplify and improve the readability of code that involves multiple if-else conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 . Conditional statements in Java are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. They allow the program to make decisions and choose different paths of execution. The main conditional statements in Java are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **if statement:** It evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true. If the condition is false, the code inside the if statement is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **if-else statement:** It evaluates a condition and executes one block of code if the condition is true, and a different block of code if the condition is false. Only one of the blocks will be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **if-else if-else statement:** It allows evaluating multiple conditions one after the other. The conditions are checked sequentially, and the code block associated with the first true condition is executed. If none of the conditions are true, the code inside the else block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "These conditional statements help control the flow of execution in a Java program based on specific conditions or criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 . The syntax of the if-else statement in Java is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (condition) {\n",
    "    // code to be executed if the condition is true\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    // code to be executed if the condition is false\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condition` is a boolean expression or a value that evaluates to true or false. If the condition is true, the code inside the if block is executed. If the condition is false, the code inside the else block is executed. The else block is optional, and it provides an alternative code path when the condition is false."

    "6. In Java, you can compare two strings using the `equals()` method or the `compareTo()` method. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `equals()`: The `equals()` method compares the content of two strings and returns `true` if they are exactly the same (i.e., have the same characters in the same order), and `false` otherwise. For example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String str1 = \"Hello\";\n",
    "String str2 = \"World\";\n",
    "\n",
    "boolean isEqual = str1.equals(str2); // false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `compareTo()`: The `compareTo()` method compares two strings lexicographically (based on their dictionary order) and returns an integer value. It returns 0 if the strings are equal, a negative value if the first string is lexicographically less than the second, and a positive value if the first string is lexicographically greater. For example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String str1 = \"Apple\";\n",
    "String str2 = \"Banana\";\n",
    "\n",
    "int result = str1.compareTo(str2); // Negative value (-1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. In Java, strings are immutable by default, which means their values cannot be changed once they are created. However, the `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` classes provide mutable string objects. These classes allow modification of strings without creating a new object each time. Here's an example using `StringBuilder`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "StringBuilder mutableString = new StringBuilder(\"Hello\");\n",
    "mutableString.append(\" World\");\n",
    "mutableString.insert(5, \" Java\");\n",
    "\n",
    "System.out.println(mutableString.toString()); // Output: Hello Java World\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, the `StringBuilder` object `mutableString` is created with an initial value of \"Hello\". The `append()` method appends \" World\" to the string, and the `insert()` method inserts \" Java\" at the fifth position. The `toString()` method converts the `StringBuilder` object back to a regular string for printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Here's an example program to sort a string alphabetically in Java:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import java.util.Arrays;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class StringSortExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        String str = \"programming\";\n",
    "        char[] charArray = str.toCharArray();\n",
    "\n",
    "        Arrays.sort(charArray);\n",
    "\n",
    "        String sortedStr = new String(charArray);\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Sorted string: \" + sortedStr);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The program takes a string (`str`), converts it to a character array (`charArray`), and uses the `Arrays.sort()` method to sort the characters in the array in ascending order. Finally, the sorted character array is converted back to a string (`sortedStr`) and printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Here's a program to check if the letter 'e' is present in the word 'Umbrella':\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class LetterCheckExample {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        String word = \"Umbrella\";\n",
    "        boolean isPresent = word.contains(\"e\");\n",
    "\n",
    "        if (isPresent) {\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"The letter 'e' is present in the word.\");\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"The letter 'e' is not present in the word.\");\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The program uses the `contains()` method to check if the letter 'e' is present in the given word. If it is present, it prints a message indicating its presence; otherwise, it prints a message indicating its absence.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. The string constant pool is a special area in the Java heap memory where string literals are stored. It is a part of the memory used to optimize memory usage and improve performance when working with strings. The string constant pool is located in the PermGen (Permanent Generation) or Metaspace memory area, depending on the Java version.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, when you create a string literal (e.g., `\"Hello\"`), it is stored in the string constant pool. If you create multiple strings with the same value, they will refer to the same memory location in the pool, reducing memory consumption. This sharing of string literals is possible because strings are immutable, so they can be safely shared among multiple references.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that since Java 8, the string constant pool has been moved from PermGen to the native memory area called Metaspace, which provides more flexibility and avoids memory leaks."
